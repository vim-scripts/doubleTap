This plugin provides an easy, way to insert matching pair characters, ie: [],(),'', and not so matchy characters like + and . , common concatenation characters.
 DoubleTap also provides a quick and easy way to terminate a line no matter where on the line the cursor is. 
For instance a double semicolon, ;;, will trim all of the white space at the end of the line and insert a semicolon at the end of the current line.
DoubleTap provides some simple abstraction functions to do the more intricate work and then provides default mappings to wire those functions to characters,pairs and events. You can easily use the core functions provided by doubleTap to create your own mappings and behaviours.
